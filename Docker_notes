Docker by default runs on linux socket but can be made to run on networks also listening for requests.


docker ps -a # gives the docker container list even if they are not runnning

dcoker run --cpu-shares=256


dcoker run memory=1g

docker run -d ubuntu:14.04.1 /bin/bash -c "ping 8.8.8.8"


docker ps

docker inspect id 

docker attach id


# Union mounts allow multiple fs to mount on top of each other but look, feel and smeel like regular filesystem,
only the top layer in a container  is read and writable.


docker pull centos will pull centos image from official docker hub if the image is not there locally.
